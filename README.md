Crystallogrphic Information Files for the first-principles study of the Thermoelectric property enhancement of single-wall carbon nanotube network by ICl intercalation and filling

C1: Iodine monochloride (ICl) molecules were oriented vertically filled inside the tube of a SWCNT in a very close spacing with neighboring dopants

C2: ICl molecules were oriented vertically filled inside the tube of a SWCNT, and far from the adjacent dopants

C3: ICl molecules were oriented horizontally outside the tube (intercalation) of a SWCNT in a very close spacing with neighboring dopants

C4: ICl molecules were oriented horizontally outside the tube (intercalation) of a SWCNT, and far from the adjacent dopants

C5: ICl molecules were oriented vertically outside the tube (intercalation) of a SWCNT in a very close spacing with neighboring dopants

C6: ICl molecules were oriented vertically outside the tube (intercalation) of a SWCNT, and far from the adjacent dopants
